# Sweet Shop Management System

This workspace contains a starter implementation for an interview-grade Sweet Shop system.

- Backend: `backend/` (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, JWT)
- Frontend: `frontend/` (Vite + React + Tailwind)

Next steps:
- Install backend deps and run the API
- Install frontend deps and run Vite dev server
- Expand API routes, add more tests, and wire frontend to backend
